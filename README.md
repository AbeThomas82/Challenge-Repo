# HoriSEOn Refactoring Code

## Description

The website that we are refactoring is for the HoriSEOn organization. Giving the site a cursory glance, it performs quite well, but when inspected, the code was very cluttered and disorganized.

The purpose of this assignment was to create a more organized code for the HoriSEOn website using more semantic HTML elements. My personal goal in this exercise was to learn how to personally make my code both more logical and easy to follow. Furthermore, an additional goal was to create a logical flow in the code that tells developers and coders the structure and sequential framework of the code upon inspection.

Images should have 'alt' commands attached, and the heading and title should be concise, effective, and organized without neglecting proper detail.

I have learned from this challenge that words do matter. Semantic language use promotes structure and clarity in web development. I hope that the assignment met instructor standards. Thank you.

## Installation

Modified index.html and style.css files in VS Code and included requisite comments.

Added all modified and untracked files in the entire repository using git.

Finally pushed all finished work to GitHub.

GitPages supplied deployed changes to launch refactored website.

## Usage

The end user should be able to get the gist of what services are offered by the HoriSEOn in order to determine whether or not the services will be beneficial enough to improve the exposure and awareness of their organization via search engines.
